# Fox_and_the_Serpent
A 3D, live-action RPG project developed between my cousin Rider Takamiya and myself. While he is the writer, I am the artist and programmer. 
This repository will be the collection of both his writings as well as my art and programming progress

Softwares Used:
Unreal Engine - Game IDE
Visual Studio - C++ IDE
Photoshop - 2D art
Blender - 3D art

Implementations:
- Main Character reference sheet
- Main Character 3D model (first pass)

Future Implementation (no order necessarily):
- Creation of Unreal Project
- Creation of World (art)
- Implementation of Story (maybe yarnspinner, who knows?)
- Weapons / Weapon Customization
- Armor / Armor Customization
- All Character References / Models
- An Overall Art Direction With the Game (semi-low-poly?)
- Music Production (outside source)
